### index.js

In the `index.js` file, an `addTax` function adds tax to a given price. Below this function, complete the `buyItem` function so that it does the following: 

Create a function called `buyItem` that:

- Takes in a number type argument `price`
- Calculates the price with tax
- Adds it to a running total
- **Returns** a message showing the cost of the item and the total spent so far

After you have completed writing for the `buyItem` function, *test* the function by using it with the following arguments

**Hint**: You will need to print this to the console to see what the function returns. 

```jsx
buyItem(20)  // "You bought an item for $21.60. Total so far: $21.60"
buyItem(10) // "You bought an item for $10.80. Total so far: $32.40"
```
